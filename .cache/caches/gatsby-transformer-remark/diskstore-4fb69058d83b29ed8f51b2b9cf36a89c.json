That’s how Neil Broomfield, founder of the Great North Pie Co describes his products.  And before I’d even tasted them there certainly was a feeling of comfort, as I stepped into the small café to get away from the deluge that was currently soaking the crowds in Ambleside.  The warming smell of pies was hugely enticing.</p>\n<p>The café itself is set within a building of that beautiful stonework which is widely associated with the Lake District and its idyllic country houses.  The simplicity and deep, muted colors of the café’s façade look at home in such a location.  The interior is small but incredibly neat, coordinated and bright.  The feeling of comfort is furthered by the rustic feel that some of the furnishings provoke.</p>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614381/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-013_l6nwsy.jpg\" alt=\"shop sign\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614385/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-004_f7qlwo.jpg\" alt=\"shop front\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(98%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614385/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-015_wsc5xh.jpg\" alt=\"shop window\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614383/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-001_ei7ozq.jpg\" alt=\"cafe interior\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614376/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-002_iz7wga.jpg\" alt=\"window seating\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<h3>Learning to make pies</h3>\n<p>Neil’s passion for comfort food echoes back to his childhood memories when his mum used to work in a bakery and bring home pasties.  After graduating from university Neil began working in restaurants alongside Michelin star chefs.  Then after travelling for a while he came back and joined the Greater Manchester police force, though an underlying desire to pursue a culinary career still remained. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I always knew I wanted to come back into it full-time.  I was just thinking of different ideas to get back into food, and I saw an advertisement for a farmers’ market.  I phoned them up and told them I had an idea to make pasties and they said to come down next month.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point Neil hadn’t even begun making pies so he began teaching himself to make pastry and practicing in his spare time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I made a few pasties and they came out alright, then I got some tins and tried making pies and they started coming out a bit better.  And then I went to the farmers’ market. I’d tried putting it off but in the end I just went for it.  I think I made about 15 pies, went there and sold those.  I was over the moon”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Farmers’ markets across the north of England became Neil’s stomping ground.  For several years he worked on the business part-time; making pies at home and taking them to the markets every weekend.  Still gradually learning, Neil was able to get feedback from customers at the markets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It takes you to lots of different areas. It’s quite nice in a way, you don’t have to invest in a building or have a shop where you’re quite static.  You’re almost testing the market and seeing how it works.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now working on the business full-time, Neil still regularly attends markets across the north of England.  The Great North Pie Co is resident at Altrinchams’s Market House, a highly successful food hall offering a range of the finest food &#x26; drink in the Manchester area.  In 2017, the café was opened in Ambleside and has since been a great success.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We always wanted to run our own little café and we always wanted to open in the Lakes. It’s a great place to serve this kind of comfort food – go for a walk, come back get a pie &#x26; mash, a couple of beers.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The prospect of being able to showcase local produce to the tourists that come to Ambleside also appealed to Neil.</p>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(98%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614378/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-018_imnhqp.jpg\" alt=\"Beef &#x26; Potato Pie Detail\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614382/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-010_i3oqgx.jpg\" alt=\"cappuccino\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614377/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-021_pn54x5.jpg\" alt=\"Pie, mash &#x26; gravy\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<h3>A showcase of high quality, local produce</h3>\n<p>The Great North Pie Co strives to to provide a product that is of high quality, using local produce.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s all about quality, it’s not about numbers.  I don’t think you want to be eating pies every day but when you do it’s got to be a treat, it’s got to be something special.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some notable ingredients currently on the menu include Swaledale native British beef(Corned beef cured for ten days), Lancashire cheese, &#x26; Stornoway black pudding.  There’s a huge emphasis on the use of local produce, an ethos that Neil wanted to reflect whilst naming the company.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We try to take everything from Yorkshire, Cumbria, and the rest of the north-west and try to highlight and promote them along the way.  We’re just trying to do something on a regional scale.  But I think the main thing is that it’s got to be good, quality produce.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the quality of products made by the Great North Pie Co has been recognized on multiple occasions – having received awards from the British Pie Awards and the BBC Food &#x26; Farming Awards.</p>\n<p>Having now pushed the company to a sustainable level, and having been recognized as a producer of great-tasting quality pies, Neil intends to keep focused on the quality of food, customer service and providing exceptional versions of this symbolic product of England’s north-west.</p>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614379/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-012_rmiux6.jpg\" alt=\"Menu &#x26; Cutlery\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614382/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-014_hocr9b.jpg\" alt=\"entrance sign\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>\n<figure class=\"markdown-grid\"><div class=\"markdown-grid-grid\" style=\"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          \">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614383/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-024_eb9zmg.jpg\" alt=\"pie being eaten\" width=\"100%;\">\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_limit,q_80,w_2000/v1568614383/posts/greatnorthpieco/greatNorthPieCo-029_pk0hwc.jpg\" alt=\"empty bowl\" width=\"100%;\">\n</div></figure>"}
