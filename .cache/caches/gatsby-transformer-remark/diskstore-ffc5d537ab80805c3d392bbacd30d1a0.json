Each salmon site consists of a series of 8-12 pens.  They are all connected by a series of pipes to a barge which usually sits at one end of the site.  The barge, known as the feed barge, contains a control room and a large supply of salmon feed.  At certain intervals the feed is dispensed through the pipes and into each pen.  This can also be operated remotely from a control room at the shore base.","position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":1,"offset":7765},"end":{"line":84,"column":588,"offset":8352}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":84,"column":1,"offset":7765},"end":{"line":84,"column":588,"offset":8352}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"These feed barges need to be refilled periodically, so I also went for a journey aboard the salmon feed carrier Havilah as the crew visited the sites and replenished the feed stocks.","position":{"start":{"line":86,"column":1,"offset":8356},"end":{"line":86,"column":183,"offset":8538}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":86,"column":1,"offset":8356},"end":{"line":86,"column":183,"offset":8538}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid-grid","style":"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(98%, 1fr));\n          "},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto,w_900/v1568614534/posts/salmonfarming/salmonfarming--6_jdtjsw.jpg","alt":"Salmon feed carrier","width":"100%;"},"children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":154,"offset":153}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"position":{"start":{"line":88,"column":1,"offset":8542},"end":{"line":90,"column":4,"offset":8711}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid-grid","style":"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(48%, 1fr));\n          "},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto,w_600/v1568614534/posts/salmonfarming/salmonfarming-copy1-6_vrf9eq.jpg","alt":"Salmon feed being loaded","width":"100%;"},"children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":164,"offset":163}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto,w_600/v1568614540/posts/salmonfarming/salmonfarming-copy1-7_rzu24e.jpg","alt":"Crewman operating winch","width":"100%;"},"children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":165},"end":{"line":3,"column":163,"offset":327}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"position":{"start":{"line":92,"column":1,"offset":8715},"end":{"line":96,"column":4,"offset":9060}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"figure","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":"markdown-grid-grid","style":"\n            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(98%, 1fr));\n          "},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"https://res.cloudinary.com/johndory/image/upload/c_scale,q_auto,w_900/v1568614547/posts/salmonfarming/salmonfarming-salmon-feed-carrier-lifting_a4c1dc.jpg","alt":"Salmon feed lifted by a crane onto the barge","width":"100%;"},"children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":1,"column":204,"offset":203}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]}],"position":{"start":{"line":98,"column":1,"offset":9064},"end":{"line":100,"column":4,"offset":9283}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In the past decade there has been a huge controversy surrounding the salmon farms, particularly in Shetland, due to the shooting of seals.
