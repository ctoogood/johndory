### Mackie Mayor

As I enter the highly acclaimed foodie fortress that is Manchester’s Mackie Mayor, the community of food & drink sellers that reside within are beginning their lunch time preparations.  Prospective diners roam the ring of stalls, searching the handwritten chalkboard menus for their ensuing lunchtime experience.  My eyes however are drawn to the two bright blue, tiled pizza ovens that sit opposite each other below the gold letters that read ‘HONEST CRUST’.  A warm glow radiates from one of these Italian gas-fired ovens.

### A Slice Of History

Rich Carver established the business in 2013, with the aim of providing top-quality sourdough pizzas around Manchester. The business began as a mobile wood-fired pizza oven that Rich took to events and markets to sell his artisan creations.  He soon became part of the array of permanent stalls at Altrincham’s award-winning Market House and Honest Crust has been featured in ‘Where to eat pizza’, an experts’ guide to great pizzerias across the globe. The renovation of a grade II listed building in Manchester’s Northern Quarter into a food & drinks hub, now known as Mackie Mayor, created another permanent stall for Rich and his team.

### The Pizza-Making

Although nothing is compromised with these pizzas, the dough is the focus.  Altered depending on ambient temperature, the dough is proved for a minimum of 36 hours and contains nothing but flour, water & salt.  I watch as a ball of dough is placed on the work surface and skillfully moulded and stretched into a blank, elliptical canvas. A bright red tomato sauce is painted on and a selection of the required toppings are then dabbed onto the base.  The margherita seems to be the most popular among a range of traditional options but some of the other more unusual creations on offer include a fennel sausage and pistachio pizza.  

Once properly composed, the pizza is pulled onto a peel and committed to the 450 degree heat of the oven.  During the 90 seconds or so that it remains in the oven, the crust, or cornicione, rises. The cheese melts, spreads across the base and begins to bubble. The cornicione then begins to char and blister.  Tom, one of the pizzaioli on duty, spins the pizza in the oven using the peel and checks the base.  As the pizza is lifted to reveal the base, it emits an incredible orange glow and has an almost translucent appearance.

The pizza is then removed from the oven & placed directly onto a plate on the counter. It sits there for a matter of seconds, steam rising as the pizza acclimatises to the room temperature.  It's soon whisked away by one of Mackie Mayor's serving staff, taken to an  anticipating customer on one of the long benches that span the centre of the room. 

_Mackie Mayor and Market House are open Tuesday to Friday every week._
