## Scallops can be found in abundance in the inshore waters around Shetland, and they are caught by a fleet of small vessels.

I observed the process that these vessels carry out on two occasions, on the *Mari Dawn* and the *Arctic Solitaire*.  On both occassions it was an early start, setting off shortly after daybreak and heading towards the fishing grounds.  

Scallops are caught using a row of dredges which are towed along the seabed and hauled in at certain times and emptied on to the deck.  The dredges look like sacks made out of a series of metal rings which are towed behind a spring loaded & teethed bar of steel.  This bar agitates the seabed and digs up the scallops.

Once the dredges are emptied on to the deck, the crew(usually only 1 or 2) will sort through the catch.  The scallops will be graded so only ones above a certain size are kept and then they will be put in baskets.  Once they have 100 in a basket these get transferred into sacks and tied.

When back ashore the sacks of scallops will be collected by companies for processing and distribution.
