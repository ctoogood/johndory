Mackerel is a hugely popular, oily fish which has a distinctive shiny and striped body.  It can be caught in abundance during its migration as they travel in huge shoals, they are renowned for biting anything in their sight.

Longline fishing involves the use of long fishing lines containing a series of evenly spaced hooks on each line and a large weight on the end.  They are attached to a winch onboard the boat which releases and reels in the lines in a jigging motion.  For mackerel fishing, the hooks do not require any bait.  The small lures and jigging motion are enough to attract the mackerel.

As the summer months end in Shetland many longlining vessels begin to appear in Lerwick harbour – a popular base for these vessels to fish for mackerel and to land their catch.  A large majority of these vessels are from Norway.

Scombrus is a Norwegian vessel whose crew I met on the piers in Lerwick harbour as they first arrived to begin mackerel fishing off the Shetland coast.  The father and son team spend the mackerel season on this vessel and then work the rest of the year on larger trawlers back in Norway.  After a short introduction I was invited to join them for a trip fishing off the east coast of Shetland.

I arrived back at the vessel at about 1am as the crew were preparing the vessel for sea.  I was given a quick tour of the vessel and then we were soon leaving the quay and heading out of the harbour.  I managed to get a few hours sleep before I woke later in the night.  I went out on deck to find the crew preparing the lines for fishing.  Metal beams were folded out to the sides of the vessel which the fishing lines were guided along.  Large weights which had been made using beer cans as molds were attached to the ends of the lines before they were dropped into the sea and the winches were started up.

The sun was rising and the sky had a beautiful purple hue.  Fishing was slow initially, only a few herring were caught.  The vessel moved position, the winches were restarted, and the mackerel began to be caught.  As the lines were reeled back in from the water, the hooks would hit the outlying beams and the mackerel were knocked off and would fall into a chute. The chute would direct the mackerel into a large well in the hull of the vessel.

This activity continued throughout the day, and there seemed to be a constant stream of mackerel being caught.  Although considered a much more fuel efficient and sustainable form of fishing than pelagic trawling for mackerel, there was one issue that I couldn’t ignore – The plight of seabirds diving for the mackerel.  On several occasions throughout the day gannets became tangled in the lines and hooks and they would be seriously injured.

As the light faded Scombrus headed for Lerwick to land their catch.  The vessel landed their mackerel at the Shetland Catch.  The mackerel was pumped directly from the well in the hull of the vessel into the factory where it was processed and packaged for shipping.
