## Over recent years Shetland has developed a reputation for supplying high-quality mussels.  Many mussel farms can be found throughout the isles, creating around 70% of Scotland's total mussel production

Shetland Select is a mussel supplier with their main mussel farms located in the northern isle of Yell, Shetland.  The mussel farms are operated by the Thomason brothers - Chris & Marvin - who I went to visit to create some images for the company.  Personally I was also intrigued to see the process which goes in to the harvesting of farmed mussels.

I was greeted on the pier at Basta Voe by Marvin and two crew members who would be working on the vessel.  First we would be taking an environmental officer out to take samples from one of the mussel sites - a weekly occurrence to check the toxin levels.  Once the sample mussels had been collected and the officer returned to shore, the vessel once again headed out to the sites to begin harvesting.

The mussels are grown on a series of ropes whch hang down from large plastic floats in the water.  The vessel approached a row of these floats and one of the crew threw a hook to catch one of the lines.  The line is then winched up to working height and connected to a machine on the vessel's deck.  This machine pulls the line through itself and strips the mussels off.  The mussels are then carried along a conveyor, washed and deposited into a large bin.  As the line is drawn into the machine one of the crew cuts off excess seaweed.

The following day I attended the factory where the mussels are processed, in nearby Cullivoe. Here I met Chris and his team, and watched as they hand selected mussels which passed through on a conveyor and were then bagged, boxed, iced, and palletised for shipping.
