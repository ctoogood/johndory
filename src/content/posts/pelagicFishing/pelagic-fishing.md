## A highly lucrative form of fishing due to the sheer volume of fish caught.  Expansive nets are trawled behind very large vessels.  With the aid of sonar technology these vessels can target large shoals of mackerel or herring.

I joined the crew of the pelagic vessel Voyager in Lerwick harbour.  The vessel and its 9 crew are northern Irish, from the fishing town of Kilkeel.  They often visit the waters surrounding Shetland during the mackerel season, as it was currently.  Arnold, the skipper of the vessel, informed me that we would be fishing for just a day, in the area north of Muckle Flugga, and then landing the catch.

We left the berth and headed out the north harbour entrance.  It would take a few hours to get to the fishing grounds.  I was allocated a cabin for the trip and had a good look around the vessel as we steamed north.  The interior of the vessel was like no other fishing vessel I’d been on.  There were many large single berth cabins, all with their own tv.  A large living area with an incredibly large flat-screen tv mounted on the wall, and multiple couches.  Large dining room and kitchen.  Although the vessel had its own chef, so there was no need to use the kitchen yourself.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner is all provided.  It all seemed so spacious and spotlessly clean.  I spent most of the voyage up in the wheelhouse with Arnold and some of the other crew. I enjoyed the 360 degree view you could get through the surrounding windows.

As we arrived at the fishing grounds, Arnold and the crew began to check the sonar for shoals of fish.  Through this technology they could get an idea of the size of the shoal and its depth.  Once they had targeted a passing shoal of mackerel, I went on deck to observe the crew prepare the net.  It was winched off a large drum at the stern of the vessel and let go into the sea.  The winching of the net seemed to be never-ending, it was hard to comprehend its physical size.  
Eventually the trawler doors were released from their position above the net hatch and lowered into the sea with the net.  The trawler doors act as wings which help spread the net open as its dragged through the water.  Lengths of wiring continued to be spooled out after until they had reached their desired depth. 

After a while the vessel reduced its speed and the net was hauled in.  The lengths of wire, the trawler doors, and then the net appeared.  At this point the winching ceased and a rope connected to the end of the net was caught.  This was hauled in along the starboard side of the vessel, and the end of the net was opened.  With the net remaining in the sea, a pump was carefully lowered overboard and into the net.  Pipes were connected to this pump which lead into a tank in the vessel’s hull.  Pumping commenced and the mackerel began to be brought aboard.

I could see around 9 fins surrounding the vessel as the fish were pumped aboard.  They were orcas, keen to get some of the catch. The crew said they would see orcas most of the times that they were hauling the net.  The pumping continued for quite some time until the net was empty and then the net was hauled into the stern of the vessel and the search for more fish continued.

After just one more haul of the net, the vessel’s tank was full.  I arrived in the wheelhouse and Arnold told me we were going to land the catch.  A better price had been offered by a factory in Denmark for the mackerel though, so instead of landing in Lerwick which was about 60 miles away we would land in Hirtshals, Denmark several hundred miles away.  When you have a catch of around 2000 tons of fish even the smallest price difference per kilo can make a huge difference.

It took just over a day to get to Denmark and when we arrived it wasn’t long before the fish were being offloaded.  A large hose was assembled on the deck and attached to the tank containing the fish.  This pumped the fish into a chute which then went directly into the back of a large trailer.  The factory was a few miles away from the harbour, so this was the only way to get the fish there.  A line of trucks waited as only one could be filled at a time.  It took over 2 days for the tank to be emptied and filled over 70 trailers.  Watching this helped but the amount of fish caught into perspective for me.

Much of this mackerel will be processed and packaged in tins for distribution to supermarkets across the globe.  The vessel was let go and we began our journey back towards Shetland. It was nice to be at sea again, and heading towards home, but home would have to wait a little while longer until we’d filled the tank with mackerel again.
