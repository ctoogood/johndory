## The unmistakable pattern of salmon cages in the sheltered voes and archipelagos around Shetland is hard to miss. The aquaculture practice behind these features has over the last few decades become a major player in the local economy. Salmon farming in Shetland is now worth over £100 million a year and provides around 300 jobs to the isles.

At 7am in early December it was still dark as the boats’ engines roared into life. The cloud of engine smoke hung in the air around the pier like a mist as the boats were prepared for their day’s work.  I watched as forklifts and cranes operated to bring everything needed on to the decks of the fleet of vessels.  The boats all set off in succession – away from the pier, under the Burra bridge and then north out of the sound towards the salmon sites.

I took two trips to the salmon sites with Grieg Seafoods, both to witness tasks involved in maintaining the health of their farmed salmon.  An initial trip to see the salmon be checked for sea lice, and then another to see the salmon get treated for sea lice.  I also made a further trip on a contracted vessel which delivers salmon feed to each site.

In the past few decades aquaculture has grown exponentially worldwide.  It now provides more than 50% of the world’s food fish.  In Scotland, salmon farming is the most prominent form of aquaculture and Scottish salmon is recognized throughout the world as being of high quality.  Having grown up in an area where rows of salmon cages are typically seen in many of the voes throughout the isles, I was keen to see the work which went on to create this renowned product.

The crew and I aboard Dolphin arrived at the first salmon site in the morning light.  The duties for the day were to catch a series of salmon from the pens in this site and then visually check them for sea lice.

The process involved mooring the vessel alongside the pen. The net covering the pen would then be removed and then food was thrown onto the surface of the water.  One of the crew then attempted to catch the fish with a net on a long pole – not an easy task it would seem.  As the salmon were caught, they were placed into a large container on the deck of the boat filled with water and anesthetic.  This allowed the salmon to be checked easier.  Once enough salmon were caught Jacob, the veterinarian, and the crew would hold each salmon and visually check them for lice.  Taking note of the amount and their sex.  The salmon were then returned to the pen, the netting was replaced, and the boat would move to the next pen.

The following visit involved a much larger number of staff, vessels and resources. As well as several of the work boats owned by Grieg Seafoods, there was also a larger well boat which carried tanks of hydrogen peroxide on its deck.  This was the chemical used to treat the salmon for sea lice.

Before pumping the chemical into the pen, the netting was raised so a large tarpaulin could be pulled underneath the pen so it would become totally enclosed.  Once this was in place, the hydrogen peroxide was pumped into the pen through a large pipe.  Tests were routinely taken, and once a certain predetermined concentration was reached the pumping was ceased.  The chemical was then left in the pen for a while before the tarpaulin was removed and the netting lowered.  This process was carried out for each pen at this site.

Over the past few years sea lice have become a major problem for salmon producers. A large percentage of salmon are killed by the diseases which these lice harbor.  Numerous methods are being practiced to remove the lice, with attempts to create as little impact to the fish and environment as possible.  Hydrogen peroxide does break down quickly in water once it has dispersed, however there are some reports that it is posing harm to other sea life.  Sea lice are gaining resistance to such treatments, and higher concentrations are being used.

The process of farming salmon is begun in a hatchery on the mainland, where salmon eggs are hatched and then kept until they are a suitable size to be transferred to the salmon sites.  Each salmon site consists of a series of 8-12 pens.  They are all connected by a series of pipes to a barge which usually sits at one end of the site.  The barge, known as the feed barge, contains a control room and a large supply of salmon feed.  At certain intervals the feed is dispensed through the pipes and into each pen.  This can also be operated remotely from a control room at the shore base.

These feed barges need to be refilled periodically, so I also went for a journey aboard the salmon feed carrier Havilah as the crew visited the sites and replenished the feed stocks.

In the past decade there has been a huge controversy surrounding the salmon farms, particularly in Shetland, due to the shooting of seals.  Seals had been entering the pens and eating the salmon stocks.  Large investments have been made by the salmon producers to install new netting to prevent seals from entering the cages.  There are still reports of the shooting of seals at some sites, but for the sites which have new netting installed it has been found to be successful.

Salmon farming is an aquaculture practice which in comparison to many other food industries, is still in its infancy and it will be interesting to see how the practice will change in the years to come.
