I arrived at the bakery at around 3am.  It had been a challenge to negotiate the winding single track road to Walls on such a bitterly cold & snowy February morning.  A warm glowing light radiated from the bakery windows - work must have already begun.

Waas bakery is in the small village of Walls (Waas) on the westside of Shetland’s mainland, about 25 miles from Lerwick.  In 2016 the bakery was bought by an American entrepreneur, Bruce Gilardi, who had a vision to create premium products that use natural, and where possible, locally sourced ingredients.  The bakery now produces a wide range of fresh bread, cakes, biscuits & pastries.

I entered the building, squeezing past several large trolleys stacked with bread rolls.  I followed the noises I could hear from further inside and reached a large room filled with many pieces of nostalgic machinery.  In the centre of the room was a large table where a man stood emptying small baskets of bread dough.  It was Bruce, and after a brief & friendly introduction, he was back to work.

One of the main changes that had been made to the bakery was the addition of freshly baked artisan breads, which are made and delivered daily.  There is a range of these breads which include sourdough, puckle loaf (cracked wheat), tattie braed (contains local potatoes), and wholemeal.   

I had arrived just as Bruce had begun to score the doughs prior to baking.  The pieces of dough were then carefully placed on large baking trays and placed in the large tiered ovens which lined one of the walls. It didn’t take long for the warming aroma of baked bread to fill the room.  

Other staff had now begun arriving and as Bruce emptied and refilled the ovens, other activities began to take place.  The focus in the early morning is the fresh breads, as they need to get baked and packaged before the delivery driver takes them away for distribution to the many small shops and supermarkets scattered throughout the isles.

Fresh doughnuts are now being made and the smell throughout the air becomes even more delightful.  The doughnuts are formed using a contraption with shapes the batter as it’s dropped in to the fryer – I’m fascinated by this mechanism.

There is a rush as orders are assembled in the packing room and more fresh bread is supplied from the oven.  Once packaged, the products are placed in trays for the corresponding customer.  As orders are completed, the overfilled trays are stacked in the end room of the bakery and placed in the back of the delivery van.  The van doors are closed, and it pulls away.  The tempo lowers slightly but everyone swiftly moves on to their next task.

Throughout the rest of the morning the activity continues, as numerous tasks are carried out concurrently by the bakery’s small, but highly organised workforce.
